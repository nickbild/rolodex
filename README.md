*More info coming soon!*

AI is improving, we are becoming more dependent on it, and soon it will turn on us — unless we save ourselves with 1990s digital organizers.

Today’s large language models (LLMs) make it easy to be more productive, learn more effectively, and they can really help to enhance creativity. They offer us conveniences that were unimaginable even a few years ago. But do you ever find these LLMs to be a little bit TOO convenient? I know I sure do.

What’ll happen if we grow dependent on these tools? Sure, it seems nice at first — everything’s easier. But then we don’t need to think anymore. Robots are telling us what’s true, making our decisions for us. SkyNet becomes real, then we all get chased by liquid metal assassin robots and meet our doom.

Don't worry, I'll show you the path to safety. Come with me if you want to live!
